JavaScript was first introduced in the early days of the public Internet, 1995. It uses Java-like syntax, hence the name JavaScript. Despite its name, JavaScript is not related to Java.</p>
<p>JavaScript is most preferred because of its compatibility with all the major browsers and is really flexible with the syntax it holds. Being a Front-end language and because it's so ubiquitous on the web. Looking at the Stack Overflow’s 2018 developer survey, JavaScript is the most popular language among developers respectively for 6 years. About 65% of them used this language last year. JavaScript is the loveliest programming language among the beginners.</p>
