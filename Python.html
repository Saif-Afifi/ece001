<p>Python is an advanced programming language that is interpreted and oriented towards objects and built on flexible and powerful connotations. It is considered one of the most used programming languages today because it is an easy language for beginners to learn as it can be read easily. Python syntax is often said to be simple, straightforward and almost like English, making it, like Java, so it's a popular choice for beginners. It offers a clean and well-organized icon, which makes it powerful enough to create a decent web app. So every developer should learn this year. Python's popularity has increased due to Google's investment in it over the past decade (in fact, a recent study showed that Python is the most common programming language in American schools).</p>

<h2>Uses:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python can be used for web and desktop applications, GUI-based desktop applications, Machine Learning and deep learning applications, data science, and network servers.</li>
<li>Python is also used to develop 2D imaging and 3D animation packages like Blender, Inkscape, and Autodesk.</li>
<li>It has also been used to create popular video games, including Civilization IV, Vegas Trike, and Toontown.</li>
<li>Python is used in scientific and computer applications such as FreeCAD and Abacus, and is also used by popular websites such as YouTube, Quora, Pinterest and Instagram.</li>
<li>NASA uses Python in its Integrated Planning System as a standard scripting language.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simple to learn and easily read.</li>
<li>Associated web frameworks for developing web-based applications.</li>
<li>Free interpreter and standard library available in source or binary on major platforms.</li>
<li>The programming language enjoys tremendous support from the community and offers many open-source libraries, frameworks, and modules that make application development a cakewalk.
For example, Python offers Django and Flask, popular libraries for web development and TensorFlow, Keras, and SciPy for data science applications.</li>
<li>Python lets you work quickly to integrate systems as a scripting or glue language. It’s also suited for Rapid Application Develop (RAD).</li>
</ul>
