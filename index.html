<h2>programming language</h2>

   <p>A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules that allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. Just as many human-based languages exist. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal. Each programming language contains a unique set of keywords (words that it understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions. These languages ​​allow computers to process large and complex swaths and amounts of information quickly and efficiently. The part of the language that a computer can understand is called a “binary”. Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling”. Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features, though many times there are commonalities between programming languages but each language has its own uses . There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today.</p>
