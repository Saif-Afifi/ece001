<h2>Web Development</h2>
	
   <p>To design websites there are two intertwining parts to look into:</p>
   <p>First, there is front-end development, which is part of the web development that creates an app that works on your browser and adjusts style, colors, and interactions.it is primarily concerned with what the website user sees. Front-end basics start with HTML and CSS using JavaScript. JavaScript has become one of the most dominant languages in the past last years for front-end work.</p>
   <p>Another part of creating websites is back-end development, which relates to the server, the computer that runs the site software and serves it to the world. It mostly concerned with routing, pages that will be delivered to the user when they visit a specific URL, as it communicates with the database that stores website information and sends this data to the user. In this part you can use Javascript just like in front-end development, or go with PHP, Ruby, C#, Elixir, Python, Erlang.</p>

<h2>Mobile apps Development</h2>

   <p>Creating mobile applications is a little difficult, as there is more than one mobile operating system and a different operating system will require different languages ​​for these applications. An operating system is part of the software on your device that is responsible for dealing with the hardware of this device, which is the layer that lies between the application you create and the hardware, whether it is a microphone, touch screen, or GPS. The two most popular operating systems are Android and IOS. Android is commonly used in Samsung while IOS is used in Apple. To create Android applications, you will need either Java or Kotlin, and to create IOS applications you will need Objective-C or Swift. Recently, it has become possible to create mobile apps for both Android and IOS using Javascript or Dart.</p>
   
<h2>Game development</h2>
   
   <p>Game development is one of the most interesting tracks out there, many developers enjoy it and there are developers developing games just for fun. Creating games requires what is called a game engine, a software that is used as a game building infrastructure and determines what the game has and what it can do. If you are familiar with Epic Games and Fortnight then Epic Games is actually a game engine and Fortnight is built upon. The languages ​​used in game development are mostly C ++, C # because they require a lot of memory improvement and fast performance to create rich graphics. It's not just C ++ and C #, but it's sort of related to the drive you're using and the platform you're targeting, and Lua and Java are also very popular candidates in the industry.</p>
